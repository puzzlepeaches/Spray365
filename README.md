# What is Spray365?
Spray365 is a password spraying tool that identifies valid credentials for Microsoft accounts (Office 365 / Azure AD). How is Spray365 different from the many other password spraying tools that are already available? Spray365 enables passwords to be sprayed from an "execution plan". While having a pre-generated execution plan that describe the spraying operation well before it occurs has many other benefits that Spray365 leverages, this also allows password sprays to be resumed (`-R` option) after a network error or other interruption. While it is easiest to generate a Spray365 execution plan using Spray365 directly, other tools that produce a compatible JSON structure make it easy to build unique password spraying workflows. 

Spray365 exposes a few options that are useful when spraying credentials. Random user agents can be used to detect and bypass insecure conditional access policies that are configured to limit the types of allowed devices. Similarly, the `--shuffle_auth_order` argument is a great way to spray credentials in a less-predictable manner. This option was added in an attempt to bypass intelligent account lockouts (e.g., Azure Smart Lockout). While itâ€™s not perfect, randomizing the order in which credentials are attempted have other benefits too, like making the detection of these spraying operations even more difficult. Spray365 also supports proxying traffic over HTTP/HTTPS, which integrates well with other tools like Burp Suite for manipulating the source of the spraying operation.

## Getting Started

### Requirements
 - Python
   - 3.9 (minimum)
   - 3.10 (recommended)

### Installation
If the package is availible via pip, you can install it with the following command:

```bash
pipx install spray365
```

If the package is not availible via pip, you can install it with the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MarkoH17/Spray365
cd Spray365
pip3 install .
```

For development purposes, you can also install it with the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MarkoH17/Spray365
cd Spray365
poetry shell
poetry install
```

### Usage

Once installed, spray365 can be used with the following commands:

```bash
spray365
s365
```

#### Generate an Execution Plan (Normal)
An execution plan is needed to spray credentials, so we need to create one! Spray365 can generate its own execution plan by running the generate command in "normal" mode: (`spray365 generate normal`). See help (`spray365 generate -h / spray365 generate normal -h`) for more detail.
```bash
spray365 generate normal -ep <execution_plan_filename> -d <domain_name> -u <file_containing_usernames> -pf <file_containing_passwords>

```
e.g.
```bash
spray365 generate normal -ep ex-plan.s365 -d example.com -u usernames -pf passwords
```

Spray365 also supports a multi tenant execution plan. This is useful when you have multiple domains that need to be sprayed. To generate a multi tenant execution plan, you can run the following command:

```bash
spray365 generate normal -ep <execution_plan_filename> -u <file_containing_emails> -pf <file_containing_passwords> -ep ex-plan.s365 -mt
```

Note that here that we do not need to specify a domain. The tool alternately pulls domains from the file containing target email addresses.

#### Generate an Execution Plan (Audit)
Spray365 can also audit multifactor authentication (MFA) and conditional access policy configurations by spraying valid credentials. Audit-style execution plans attempt all combinations of User-Agent + AAD Client ID + AAD Endpoint ID for a given pair of credentials.

Spray365 can generate an audit-style execution plan by running the generate command in "audit" mode: (`spray365 generate audit`). See help (`spray365 generate -h / spray365 generate audit -h`) for more detail. While it is possible to provide a list of users and passwords separately (`-u` and `-pf`), these options better suit execution plans for password spraying (not auditing), which would likely cause many invalid login attempts. Instead, consider `-u / --user_file` with `--passwords_in_userfile`, which will instruct Spray365 to extract the passwords from "user_file" by splitting each line in the input file on a colon, where the value before the colon is treated as the username, and the value after the colon is treated as the password (e.g. `<username>:<password>`, `jsmith:Password01`). 

```bash
spray365 generate audit -ep <execution_plan_filename> -d <domain_name> -u <file_containing_usernames_and_passwords> --passwords_in_userfile
```
e.g.
```bash
spray365 generate audit -ep ex-plan.s365 -d example.com -u usernames --passwords_in_userfile
```

#### Spraying an Execution Plan
Once an execution plan is created, Spray365 can be used to process it. Running Spray365 in "spray" (`spray365 spray`) mode will process the specified execution plan and spray the appropriate credentials. All types of execution plans (normal and audit) can be processed in this mode. See help (`spray365.py spray -h`) for more detail.
```bash
spray365 spray -ep <execution_plan_filename>
```
e.g.
```bash
spray365 spray -ep ex-plan.s365
```

Spray365 also supports a backoff strategy for dynamically pausing and resuming spray operations. This is useful to perform long term password sprays wherein Azure AD is falsely reporting a locked account. This option is enabled using the backoff and backoff threshold commands:
  
  ```bash
  spray365 spray -ep <execution_plan_filename> -b <backoff_time_minutes> -bt <backoff_threshold> -l <lockout>
  ```

  e.g.
  ```bash
  spray365 spray -ep ex-plan.s365 -b 60 -bt 10 -l 10
  ```

The command above will execute a password spray. If the lockout threshold is met, the spray will pause for the specified backoff time. Everytime the lockout threshold is met after the first backoff time threshold is met, the backoff time period will double. If this backoff time period is expanded beyond the backoff threshold, the spray will stop.


#### Reviewing the Results of a Spraying Operation
After spraying credentials from an execution plan, Spray365 outputs a JSON file with the results. This file can be processed using other tools like JQ to gain insights about the spraying operation after it has occurred. However, Spray365 also includes a "review" command which can be used to learn about:
 - Valid (and invalid) Accounts
 - Valid (and invalid) Credentials
 - Partial Valid Credentials (Authentication succeeded, but access was prevented by MFA / Conditional Access Policies)

See help (`spray365 review -h`) for more detail.
```bash
spray365 review <spray_results_json_filename>
```
e.g.
```bash
spray365 review spray365_results_2022-05-20_18-58-31.json
```

                                  a random order with a random arrangement of
                                  passwords, e.g (User4:Pass16, User13:Pass25,
                                  User19:Pass40). Be aware this option
                                  introduces the possibility that the time
